Here is the explanation of the Bento Box transformation and utilization of the extra space, presented with a visual aid concept.

## 🍱 Bento Box Layout Transformation

The key principle is to take the scattered elements (like the image, description, Quick Quote, and Contact Us) and organize them into aesthetically pleasing, self-contained cards within a responsive grid.

### 1. Conceptual Visual Aid (Bento Box Grid)

The current layout has a main column and a narrow sidebar. The Bento style reframes this into two or three flexible columns of "cards" or "boxes."

| Box (2/3 width) | Box (1/3 width) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Product Image & Title** (Full width in this row) | **Quick Quote / Estimate** (Small, impactful) |
| **Customization Request Form** (Large input area) | **Contact Us / Customer Support** (Essential info) |
| **Customization Inputs (Qty/Date)** | **Quality Materials Info** (Short bulleted list) |
| **Request Customization Button** | **Next Steps (Turnaround/Design Assist)** (Short, encouraging text) |

### 2. Breakdown of the Bento Boxes

* **Product Box (Top Left, Large)**:
    * **Content**: Keep the **Product Title ("Big Table Lamp")** and the **Product Image**.
    * **Style**: Make this a large, prominent card to draw the user's eye immediately to the item they are customizing.
* **Customization Request Box (Mid-Left, Large)**:
    * **Content**: Dedicate a large card to the `Customization Requirements` text area. This emphasizes the importance of the user's detailed input.
    * **Style**: A simple white card with a title.
* **Quick Quote Box (Top Right, Small)**:
    * **Content**: **Material** and **Volume** inputs, and the **Get Estimate** button.
    * **Style**: A distinct card with a light background to clearly separate the estimation tool from the rest of the form.
* **Action/Form Box (Bottom Left, 2 smaller cards)**:
    * Place the `Quantity` and `Target Date` inputs into smaller horizontal fields below the main text area.
    * Place the **Request Customization** button in its own prominent action box, perhaps spanning the full width of the left column.
* **Info Stack (Right Column, 3+ small cards)**:
    * Group the informational blocks into separate, bite-sized cards:
        1.  **Contact Us**.
        2.  **Quality Materials** (A brief bulleted list is ideal here).
        3.  **Fast Turnaround**.
        4.  **Design Assistance**.

## 3. Utilizing the Extra Space Below the Form

The large empty space at the bottom of the current screenshot is an opportunity to add valuable, trust-building, and supporting content.

* **Trust and Authority Building:**
    * **Case Studies/Portfolio Slider:** Show examples of custom 3D prints you have successfully completed. *E.g., "See Our Work: Custom Lamps for Top Hotels"*. This builds confidence.
    * **Client Testimonials:** A brief, rotating testimonial section emphasizing the quality and speed of your service.
* **Supporting Information (FAQ/Process):**
    * **How It Works - Visual Timeline:** Create a simple 3-step graphic explaining the customization process: **1. Submit Details** (this form) **-> 2. Receive Quote & Approval -> 3. Printing & Delivery**.
    * **Detailed FAQ Section:** Answer common questions related to materials, pricing, and deadlines (e.g., "What if I don't have a 3D model?", "What file formats are accepted?").
* **Cross-Promotion:**
    * **Related Services:** If you offer other services (like rapid prototyping or large-volume runs), link them here. *E.g., "Need a larger batch? Contact our Commercial team."*

The Bento layout naturally pushes supporting content into the available space, making the entire page feel structured and complete, while keeping the primary task (the customization form) front and center.
